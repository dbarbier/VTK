Subject: Allow wrapping of vtkRenderWindow::GetColorBufferSizes

See http://www.vtk.org/Bug/view.php?id=7857

When color depth is lower than 24, vtkVisibleCellSelector::Select()
silently fails.  We want to detect this case to provide
a software alternative, or at least tell user why picking
does not work.
